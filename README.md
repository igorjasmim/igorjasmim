## Hello! My name is Igor Jasmim ðŸ‘‹

About Me ðŸ‘‹
Hello! I'm an Electrical and Data Engineer with a Masterâ€™s degree in Engineering and a Postgraduate certification in Project Management. My professional journey has been a fusion of technical expertise and strategic thinking, enabling me to tackle complex challenges with innovative solutions.

Currently, I wear two hats:

Systems Analyst: I work on designing and optimizing systems that bridge the gap between data, technology, and business needs.
University Professor: Sharing my knowledge and passion for engineering and data with the next generation of professionals.
With a strong foundation in engineering and a keen eye for data-driven problem-solving, I am always eager to collaborate on projects that push boundaries, create impactful solutions, and advance the integration of technology into everyday life.

Letâ€™s connect and build something amazing together! ðŸš€
